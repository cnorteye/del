            <h2>Addendum</h4>
                <p>
                    The reason I structured my website the way I did was to replicate my resume as closely as possible. 
                    My resume included lists, headers, and a bolded line under every heading. 
                    Additionally, there were a few line items that were bolded but didn't serve as headers. 
                    For these cases, I used the bold tag within the paragraph tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enhanced parts of the resume by including the italic tags, which helped bring a different dimension to the resume since it was online. 
                    The use of the style tag enabled me to maintain consistent styling throughout the website without duplicating my work.
                </p>
